## Diversity & Inclusion

Anyone, from any background, should feel encouraged to participate and contribute to RV. Differences – in age, race, gender and sexual orientation, nationality, physical ability, thinking style and experience – bring richness to our efforts in providing quality programs and services for the global runtime verification community.

RV is committed to creating an environment that welcomes new ideas and perspectives, and where hostility or other antisocial behaviors are not tolerated.

## Policy Against Harassment at RV Activities

The open exchange of ideas is central to RV’s mission. This requires an environment that embraces diversity and provides a safe, welcoming environment for all. This policy applies to all RV activities.

### Expected Behavior

We expect all participants in RV activities to abide by this policy in all venues, including ancillary events and unofficial social gatherings:

* Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions;
* Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech;
* Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants;
* Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this policy, even if they seem inconsequential.

### Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable at any RV activity is:

* **Abuse**: Any action directed at an individual that (a) interferes substantially with that person’s participation; or (b) causes that person to fear for his/her personal safety. This includes threats, intimidation, bullying, stalking, or other types of abuse.
* **Discriminatory Harassment**: Any conduct that discriminates or denigrates an individual on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, citizenship, nationality, age, sexual or gender identity, disability, or any other characteristic protected by law in the location where the RV activity takes place.
* **Sexual Harassment**: Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal/physical conduct of a sexual nature. Examples include (but are not limited to):

  - unwelcome advances or propositions, particularly when one individual has authority over the other;
  - inappropriate touching of an individual’s body;
  - degrading or humiliating comments about an individual’s appearance;
  - using an activity-related communication channel to display or distribute sexually explicit images or messages;

Unacceptable behaviors include, but are not limited to:

* intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech or actions by any participant in RV activities, at all related events and in one-on-one communications carried out in the context of RV activities;
* offensive, degrading, humiliating, harmful, or prejudicial verbal or written comments or visual images related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability, age, appearance, or other personal characteristics;
* unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal/physical conduct of a sexual nature;
* inappropriate or gratuitous use of nudity, sexual images, or stereotyped images including using an activity-related communication channel to display or distribute sexually explicit or otherwise offensive or discriminatory images or messages;
* deliberate intimidation, stalking or following;
* harassing photography or recording;
* sustained disruption of talks or other events;
* unwelcome and uninvited attention or contact;
* physical assault (including unwelcome touch or groping);
* real or implied threat of physical harm;
* real or implied threat of professional or financial damage or harm.

Harassment can occur when there is no deliberate intention to offend. Be careful in the words that you choose. Harassment committed in a joking manner or disguised as a compliment still constitutes unacceptable behavior. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

If a participant in an RV activity engages in prohibited behavior, RV reserves the right to take any action RV deems appropriate. RV reserves the right to:

* remove an individual from any RV activity without warning or refund;
* prohibit an individual from participating in future RV activities, including publishing in RV publications;
* exclude an individual from RV leadership positions;
* exclude any individual from deriving other benefits from RV activities;

Appropriate sanctions also will be taken toward any individual who knowingly makes a false allegation of harassment.

## How to Report Unacceptable Behavior

Any individual who experiences harassment (as described above) at any RV activity can report this to any member of the RV steering committee.
